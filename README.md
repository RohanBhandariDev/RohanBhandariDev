# Hi, I'm <ROHAN>

I'm a backend engineering learner focused on understanding systems from first principles.

## Current Focus
- JavaScript (deep fundamentals)
- Node.js runtime behavior
- Asynchronous programming
- TypeScript (learning in parallel)

## How I Learn
- Build from basics instead of copying patterns
- Write small, focused examples
- Document what I understand and what I don’t
- Prioritize clarity over speed

## Learning Repositories
- js-learning-roadmap → structured JavaScript learning
- (more added as I progress)

## Long-Term Goals
- Strong backend fundamentals
- System-level understanding
- Writing clean, maintainable code

Learning in public. Improving daily.
